## FAQ
Q: Why are you using Minecraft 1.6.4

A: I know Minecraft 1.6.4 is very outdated, however most of the mods I have come to like and love seem to be more performant on Minecraft 1.6.4 at this present time, which has prevented me from putting Minecraft 1.7.10 into production. I am however working on porting this modpack to Minecraft 1.7.10 which can be found at http://github.com/HelenaKitty/EbooModPack-1.7.10 !
